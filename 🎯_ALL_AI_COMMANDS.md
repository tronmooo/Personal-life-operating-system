## 💡 TIPS

### Natural Language
You don't need exact phrasing. The AI understands:
- "I weigh about 180 pounds" ✅
- "my weight is around 175" ✅
- "weigh 170" ✅

### Flexibility
Commands work with variations:
- "spent $50 on food" = "paid 50 dollars for food" = "bought $50 food"
- "10000 steps" = "walked 10000 steps" = "took 10000 steps"

### Case Insensitive
- "Weigh 175 Pounds" = "weigh 175 pounds" ✅

### Units
Most units are optional:
- "weigh 175" assumes pounds (lbs)
- "water 16" assumes ounces (oz)
- But you can specify: "weigh 75 kg" or "drank 500 ml"
