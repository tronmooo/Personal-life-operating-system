## 🎨 Test Cases

### Test 1: Work Stress (Specific)

late every night but still falling behind.
```

---

### Test 2: Relationship Conflict (Specific)
**Write:**

```

**Expected Actions:** Specific to household communication, expressing needs, conflict resolution

---

### Test 3: Loneliness (Specific)
**Write:**
```
I moved to a new city 3 months ago and still haven't made any friends.

```

### Test 4: Career Anxiety (Specific)
**Write:**
```
I've been in the same role for 3 years while my colleagues get promoted.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ Good Journals (Detailed):
- Include specific situations
- Mention specific people/places
- Describe what you're feeling AND why
- Give context about what's happening

### ❌ Bad Journals (Too Vague):
- "I'm stressed"
- "Having a bad day"
- "Feeling down"
- One sentence entries

**Rule:** The more detail you give, the more helpful the AI's actions will be!

## 🔍 What to Look For

### The Actions Should Be:

✅ **Specific to your situation**  
Example: "Tell your boss you need to push the new project to next week" (not just "set boundaries")

✅ **Actually doable**  
Example: "Schedule 15 minutes tomorrow morning to plan" (not "reorganize your entire life")

✅ **Relevant to what you wrote**  
Example: If you wrote about a fight, actions about communication (not about exercise)

✅ **With emoji icons**  
Example: 📞 💬 📝 🎯 (makes them easy to scan)

## 🎯 Compare: Generic vs AI-Generated

### Generic (Keyword Matching):
**Journal:** "I'm stressed about work deadlines"

**Actions:**
- 🧘 Take 3 deep breaths
- 📝 Write down ONE task
- 🚶 Take a walk

**→ Could apply to anyone!**

---

### AI-Generated (Contextual):
**Journal:** "I have a huge presentation tomorrow and haven't practiced. My boss will be there and I'm terrified of forgetting what to say."

**Actions:**
- ⏰ Practice your opening 3 times in front of a mirror tonight - first 2 minutes are crucial
- 📝 Write key points on one index card you can glance at - full slides aren't needed
- 🧘 Before you start, take 3 deep breaths and imagine your boss nodding along - visualize success

**→ Specific to presentation anxiety with boss!**
