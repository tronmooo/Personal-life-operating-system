## 💡 Why These Work

I added **"simple catch-all patterns"** at the TOP of the command checker:

1. **"spent $X anything"** → Detects ANY expense
2. **"did X minute anything"** → Detects ANY workout
3. **More flexible patterns** for all other commands

**No more strict requirements!** Just say it naturally.

## 🔍 How to Check if It Worked

### In Browser Console (F12):
```
Look for:
🔍 Checking command: "spent $50 groceries"
✅ SIMPLE EXPENSE: $50 for groceries
✅ [SAVE SUCCESS] Saved to financial domain!
```

### In UI:
1. **Financial Domain** → Should see $50 groceries
2. **Command Center** → Should see recent expense
3. **Refresh if needed** (Ctrl+Shift+R)

## ⚠️ If Still Not Working

1. **Open Console** (F12) and look for errors
2. **Check for**:
   - `🔍 Checking command:` (should appear)
   - `✅ SIMPLE EXPENSE:` or `✅ SIMPLE WORKOUT:` (should appear if matched)
   - `❌ Error` messages

3. **Copy the console logs** and send them to me
