# 🎉 FRESH START - CACHE CLEARED, TRY NOW!

## What I Just Did

1. ✅ **Deleted the entire `.next` cache**
2. ✅ **Killed all old server processes**
3. ✅ **Started fresh server on port 3000**
4. ✅ **New ElevenLabs API code is now loaded**

---

## 🧪 TEST IT RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Close ALL Browser Tabs
- Close every tab for `localhost:3000` AND `localhost:3001`
- This clears the browser's connection cache

### Step 2: Open Fresh Browser Tab
- Go to: `http://localhost:3000/concierge`
- **Hard refresh:** `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+F5` (Windows)

### Step 3: Make a Call
1. Type: "What's the price of pizza from Domino's"
2. Click "Make Call"

### Step 4: Check Your Terminal

**You should NOW see NEW output:**
```
🤖 Smart Call Request: What is the price of pizza from Domino's
📞 Making call via ElevenLabs API...  ← NEW!
Agent ID: agent_6901k726zn05ewsbet5vmnkp549y
Instructions: Hello, I'm an AI assistant calling on behalf of...  ← NEW!
✅ Call initiated successfully: { conversation_id: "..." }  ← NEW!
```

**NOT this (old code):**
```
📞 Making Twilio call to ElevenLabs...  ← OLD
From: +17279662653  ← OLD
```

## 🚨 If You Get an Error

**Copy the EXACT terminal output** and send it to me. It will tell me:

1. If the new code is running
2. What ElevenLabs error (if any) is happening
3. If your agent needs configuration

## 📊 The Errors You Saw

Those **React hydration errors** in your browser console are **NOT related** to the calling feature - they're just Next.js dev warnings about server/client rendering mismatches. They don't affect functionality.
