## 💡 Why You Might Think Only Financial Works

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Financial has extra features** (enhanced view, more complex)
2. **Financial is listed first** (so you tested it most)
3. **The 500 error** made other domains seem broken (but we fixed that!)
4. **Analytics might show $0** for other domains (because they're empty)

### But The Truth Is:
✅ All domains have the same core functionality:
- Add new items
- Edit items
- Delete items
- View list of items
- Documents tab
- Analytics tab
- Quick Log tab (for supported domains)

✅ Some domains have enhanced views:
- Financial
- Health
- Home
- Vehicles

✅ Some domains have Quick Log:
- Health
- Pets
- Mindfulness
