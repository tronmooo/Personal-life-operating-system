## 📋 STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (1 minute)

1. **Open this link**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `lifehub-personal-dashboard`
3. **Description**: `My personal life management system`
4. **Visibility**: Select **🔒 Private**
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, no .gitignore)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## 🎯 STEP 2: Run the Push Script (30 seconds)

In your terminal, run:

```bash
./PUSH_NOW.sh
```

The script will:
1. Ask you to press ENTER (after you create the repo)
2. Ask for your GitHub username
3. Push everything to GitHub!

**If it asks for a password**, you need a **Personal Access Token**:
- Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Check the "repo" box
- Copy the token and use it as your password

---

## 🎉 DONE!

After pushing, visit:
**https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lifehub-personal-dashboard**

---

## 🆘 If Script Doesn't Work

Manually run these commands:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lifehub-personal-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
