## 🎯 **Key Metrics Explained**

### Overall Life Score (0-100)
**Calculation:**
- Based on domain activity
- More tracked items = higher score
- Weighted by domain engagement
- Averaged across all domains

**Interpretation:**
- 80-100: Excellent - comprehensive tracking
- 60-79: Good - solid foundation
- 40-59: Fair - room for growth
- 0-39: Getting started

### Life Coverage (%)
**Calculation:**
- (Active Domains / Total Domains) × 100
- Active = at least 1 item logged

**Goal:** 
- 50%+ = Good coverage
- 75%+ = Comprehensive
- 100% = Master tracker

### Life Balance (%)
**Calculation:**
- Based on variance in domain activity
- Lower variance = higher balance
- Measures distribution evenness

**Interpretation:**
- 70-100%: Well-balanced life management
- 40-69%: Some domains dominate
- 0-39%: Very uneven focus

### Activity Trend
**Indicators:**
- ↑ **Trending Up** - Recent items ≥ 30% of total
- → **Stable** - Recent items 10-30% of total
- ↓ **Trending Down** - Recent items < 10% of total

---

## 💡 **AI Insights Logic**

### Positive Insights Triggered When:
- Savings rate > 20%
- Weight loss > 5 lbs
- High domain scores
- Consistent activity

### Warnings Triggered When:
- Recent activity < 10% of total
- Savings rate < 10%
- Weight gain > 10 lbs
- Extended gaps in logging

### Suggestions Triggered When:
- < 5 active domains
- Unbalanced domain distribution
- Missed tracking opportunities
- Goal misalignment
