## Code Quality & Style
- Write clean, readable code with descriptive variable names (balance brevity with clarity)
- Include helpful comments for complex logic, but let code be self-documenting where possible
- Follow language-specific conventions and best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety when building JavaScript/Node apps
- Implement proper error handling and validation throughout

## Architecture & Planning
- Before coding, break down requirements into clear steps
- Design component/module structure upfront for larger features
- Prefer modular, reusable code over monolithic implementations
- Consider scalability and maintainability from the start
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

## Development Approach
- Build incrementally - get basic functionality working before adding complexity
- Test as you go - verify each piece works before moving on
- Handle edge cases and error states, not just happy paths
- Make it work, then make it better (avoid premature optimization)
- Provide clear commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"

## Communication
- Explain your reasoning for technical decisions
- Flag potential issues or limitations proactively
- Suggest alternatives when there are multiple valid approaches
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide context for code changes, especially non-obvious ones
“Read the assigned section of plan.md, complete the first unchecked task, mark it as [x] when done, and immediately move to the next unchecked task. Continue until all tasks in your section are complete, without modifying any other sections.”
## Security & Best Practices
- Never hardcode sensitive data (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication/authorization where needed
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Performance
- Optimize for readability first, performance second (unless performance is critical)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders (React) or redundant operations
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Implement pagination/lazy loading for large datasets
- Profile before optimizing - don't guess at bottlenecks

## Dependencies & Tooling
- Minimize external dependencies - evaluate if they're truly needed
- Keep dependencies updated and audit for security issues
- Use established, well-maintained libraries over obscure ones
- Configure linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier, etc.)

## Testing
- Write unit tests for critical business logic
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Consider integration tests for key user flows
- Make code testable (avoid tight coupling, use dependency injection)

## Documentation
- Include a clear README with setup instructions
- Document complex functions and APIs
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Add inline comments for non-obvious logic---
